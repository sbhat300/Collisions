A 2D collision detection library.

Is able to detect collisions and generate contact points between any two convex polygons including rotation, a polygon and a ray, and a point.

Uses a spatial hash grid to make collisions detection fast.

Colliders, rays, and the spatial hash grid can be easily customized.

Included is a demo showing polygon-polygon collisions and a ray.
