A 2D collision detection library.

Able to detect collisions and generate contact points between any two convex polygons (including rotation), a polygon and a ray, and a point.

Uses a spatial hash grid to optimize collisions detection.

Colliders, rays, the spatial hash grid, and everything else can be easily customized.

Included is a demo showing polygon-polygon collisions and a ray.
